'''Q1 : Creat a list

#Q2 : Creat a Tuple and modify it by removing 4th element *Hint : convert first to list and then convert back to tuple

#Q3 : Create a tuple and print it's elements using for and while loop

newtuple = ("one","two","three","four","five","six")
print("By for Loop")
for i in newtuple:
  print(i)
print("==============")
print("By for while loop")
